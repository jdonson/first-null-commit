	Task 2:		Clone to local and Null Commit to First-Null-Commit repo.  Straight solo push.

	Task 3:		First problem:  github origin repo is ahead of your local repo

	Task 4:		Second problem:  same, but you wanted to undo your last prior commit

	Task 5:		Third problem:  same, but you also just committed to local repo and have not yet pushed.  Deadlock?

	Task 6:		Use diagrams to clarify the conflicts at play.
